# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This Python project predicts telecom customer churn using models like LightGBM and PyTorch NN. It preprocesses data, balances classes via SMOTE, and tunes for ~97% accuracy. Insights from feature importances and probability segments (e.g., low risk: rewards; high: outreach) enable targeted retention strategies to cut churn.
